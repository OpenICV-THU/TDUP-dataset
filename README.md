# Tsinghua-Daimler Urban Pose Dataset


***Note: The official website will be linked here after the construction is finished. There will be a fantastic dataset soon!***


## Introduction

**Tsinghua-Daimler Urban Pose Dataset (TDUP)**  is a large-scale human pose estimation dataset focusing on **vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban traffic scenes**. There are around **90K VRU instances** manually labelled with bounding boxes, including nearly 40K pedestrians and 50K riders. All these instances whose bounding boxes height are greater than 60 pixels are carefully labelled with skeleton joint points. Instance attributes like occlusion and truncation are also provided. All the  images were collected with high-resolution (at least 1920 x 1024 pixels) on-board camera in Chinese urban streets, where the situations are complex and various. With these **20K labelled images**, TDUP is expected to play an important role in studying VRUs action for  autonomous driving or other related fields.

The dataset is coming soon and the certain statistics will be updated with its publication.
